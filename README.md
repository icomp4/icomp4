# Hi, I'm Isaiah

I'm a New York–based software engineer with 8+ years of experience writing code — mainly in **Go**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.  
Currently working on:

- [**Bookie Bandit**](https://whop.com/discover/bookiebandit/) - automated sports betting bot
- [**Corli**](https://www.corli.app) - gamified productivity app that turns real-world goals into quests, XP, and skill growth.
